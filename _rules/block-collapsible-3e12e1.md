## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectations

For each [section of repeated content][] in the test target, there exists some interactive element which:

- is [visible][]; and
- is [included in the accessibility tree][]; and
- can be activated; and
- when activated, allows to toggle both [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of this [section of repeated content][].

**Note:** the same element may be used for several or even all the [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content].

**Note:** [Technique SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content][tech scr28] does not require the [accessible name][] of the [user interface component][] (interactive element) to be descriptive. However, having a non-descriptive [accessible name][] is likely a failure of [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value).

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content] have already been identified within the test target, for example by comparison with other test targets within the same website, or any other means.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content][tech scr28]

## Test Cases

**Note:** Unless specified otherwise, the [sections of content][] of each document are defined by the [landmarks][landmark] (`aside`, `main` and `nav` elements); both the complementary and navigational [sections of content][] (`aside` and `nav` elements) are [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content].

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of the navigational [section of repeated content][] can be toggled on and off by the link at the start of the document.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/toggle-display.js"></script>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="#" onclick="toggleHidden('navigation')">Toggle table of content</a>
		<nav id="navigation">
			<h1>Contents</h1>
			<!-- list of links to each chapter, repeated on each page -->
		</nav>
		<main>
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

The [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of both the complementary and the navigational [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content] can be toggled on and off by the button at the start of the document.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/toggle-display.js"></script>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<button onclick="toggleHidden(['navigation', 'biography'])">Toggle repeated content</button>
		<nav id="navigation">
			<h1>Contents</h1>
			<!-- list of links to each chapter, repeated on each page -->
		</nav>
		<aside id="biography">
			<h1>About the authors</h1>
			<!-- short biography of the author and translator -->
		</aside>
		<main>
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of both the complementary and the navigational [sections of repeated content][section of repeated content] can be toggled on and off, each of them by a different element.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/toggle-display.js"></script>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="#" onclick="toggleHidden('navigation')">Toggle table of content</a>
		<button onclick="toggleHidden('biography')">Toggle extra content</button>
		<nav id="navigation">
			<h1>Contents</h1>
			<!-- list of links to each chapter, repeated on each page -->
		</nav>
		<aside id="biography">
			<h1>About the authors</h1>
			<!-- short biography of the author and translator -->
		</aside>
		<main>
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
