## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectation

For each test target, the outcome of at least one of the following rules is passed:

- [Document has heading for main section of content][]; or
- [Document has a main landmark][]; or
- [Link for skipping block of content][]; or
- [Block of content is expandable and collapsible][]; or
- [First focusable element is link to main content][]; or
- [First focusable elements are links to sections of content][].

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that the mean to bypass blocks is included in the content of the [HTML web page][]. For example, server side scripting can provide a functionality similar to [Block of content is expandable and collapsible][] by serving a modified version of the page; in which case this rule would fail but [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass blocks][sc241] could nonetheless be satisfied.
- This rule assumes that `frame` and `frameset` elements are not used, given that they are deprecated in HTML5. They can be used to organize content as per [H70: Using frame elements to group blocks of repeated material](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H70) and [H64: Using the title attribute of the frame and iframe elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H64), in which case this rule would fail but [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass blocks][sc241] could nonetheless be satisfied.

## Accessibility Support

Techniques and solutions that identify blocks of content are sufficient ways of passing [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass blocks][sc241]. They are, however, only beneficial for users who have ways of navigating with this information. For example, adding headings to a document will only help users who can "jump" from heading to heading (such a possibility can be provided by browsers, browsers plugins, screen readers, or other assistive technologies). Techniques and solutions based on links will benefit all users (for example, keyboard users with no other assistive technology) and are therefore recommended.

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks][usc241]
- Creating links to skip blocks of content:
  - [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1)
  - [G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G123)
  - [G124: Adding links at the top of the page to each area of the content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G124)
- Grouping and identifying blocks of content:
  - [ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA11)
  - [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H69)
  - [SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/client-side-script/SCR28)

## Test Cases

**Note:** Unless specified otherwise, the [sections of content][] of each document are defined by the [landmarks][landmark]; the banner, complementary and navigational [sections of content][] (`header`, `aside` and `nav` elements) are [sections of repeated content][]; and the banner and complementary [sections of content][] do not include any [focusable][] element not shown explicitly.
