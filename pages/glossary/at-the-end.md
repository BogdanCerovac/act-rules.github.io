A node is _at the end_ of a [block of content][block] if one of the following is true:

- the node is the first [perceivable content][] outside this [block][] and after it; or
- the node is not [perceivable content][], is after the last [perceivable content][] in this [block][] and there is no other [perceivable content][] between the [block][] and the node.

In other words, the node is either the first [perceivable content][] after the [block][], any non-[perceivable content][] after the block but before the next [perceivable content][], or any non-[perceivable content][] inside the [block][] but after the last [perceivable content][] in it.

Several nodes may be at the end of a [block][], especially if there are several non-[perceivable content][] nodes next to each other.

Order ("first", "before", â€¦) in this definition is [tree order][] in the [flat tree][].
