A node is _at the start_ of a [block of content][block] if one of the following is true:

- the node is the first [perceivable content][] inside this [block][]; or
- the node is not [perceivable content][], is before the first [perceivable content][] in this [block][] and there is no other [perceivable content][] between the node and the [block][].

In other words, the node is either the first [perceivable content][] inside the [block][], any non-[perceivable content][] before the block but after the previous [perceivable content][], or any non-[perceivable content][] inside the [block][] but before the first [perceivable content][] in it.

Several nodes may be at the start of a [block][], especially if there are several non-[perceivable content][] nodes next to each other.

Order ("first", "before", â€¦) in this definition is [tree order][] in the [flat tree][].
