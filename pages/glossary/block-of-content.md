A _block of content_ in an [HTML web page][] is a set of [perceivable content][] from that page with is a segment of all [perceivable content][] from that page, in tree order (i.e. there is no [perceivable content][] which is out of this set but between the first and last nodes of it).

Note that when the rendering order of nodes on a page greatly differ from the DOM order, blocks of content as defined here may be different from what is visually perceived as "content in close relationship".
