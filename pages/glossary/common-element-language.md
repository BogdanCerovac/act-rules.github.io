An element has a _common language_ if all _words_ in the [text with the same programmatic language][] of the element are part of the same language from the [language subtag registry][], except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text. Words can be part of other languages as long as they are also part of the unique language. In the rare case where all words are part of several languages, an element may have several _common languages_.

For more details, see [examples of common language](/pages/examples/element-language/).
